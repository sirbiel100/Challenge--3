# Frontend Mentor - Interactive rating component solution

This is a solution to the [Interactive rating component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 



## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

### Links

- Live Site URL: [GIT-HUB LIVE SITE](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript events 


### What I learned

I learned so much more practicing Javascript, searching for help and hints i learned more about events.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  :active;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  onClick
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development

I want continue practing javascript and its components (HTML and CSS) until i finally learn how it works!
